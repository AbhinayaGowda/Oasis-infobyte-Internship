      <h2>Visionary • Scientist • Inspiration</h2>

      <p>
        Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was not merely a scientist or the former President of India,
        but a symbol of inspiration for millions. Born into a humble family, his life proves
        that dedication, discipline, and belief in dreams can shape greatness.
      </p>

      <p>
        What made Dr. Kalam truly remarkable was his humility and love for students.
        He believed knowledge must be shared and that young minds are the foundation
        of a strong and self-reliant nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        He taught us that dreams are not what we see while sleeping, but what keep us awake
        with purpose. His legacy continues to guide generations toward integrity,
        curiosity, and service to humanity.
