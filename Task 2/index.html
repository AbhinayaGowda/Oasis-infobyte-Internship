      <h1>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
      <h3>Missile Man of India • Visionary Leader • Inspiration</h3>

      <p>
        Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was not merely a scientist or the former President of India,
        but a guiding force for millions of young dreamers. Born into a humble family,
        his journey stands as a powerful example of how discipline, perseverance,
        and dedication can transform dreams into reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        What truly made Dr. Kalam exceptional was his humility and deep connection with students.
        He believed that knowledge has true value only when it is shared, and he devoted his life
        to inspiring young minds to think creatively and act responsibly for the nation’s future.
      </p>

      <p>
        His life teaches us that success is not measured by position or power,
        but by integrity, service, and contribution to society. Even today,
        Dr. Kalam’s vision continues to inspire people to dream big and work with purpose.
